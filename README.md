# simple_ml

This repo demonstrates code used to create a simple ML app (at the time of writing hosted at http://simple-ml-viz.herokuapp.com/)

I present my python code written in OOP used for the predictive model. 

This does not include the application and source file. That instread queries csvs generated from this code.
