# simple_ml

This repo demonstrates code used to create a simple ML app (at the time of writing hosted at http://simple-ml-viz.herokuapp.com/)

I present my python code written in OOP used for predictive models in that application. 

This does not include the application and source file. That instead queries .csvs generated from this code.

The requirements.txt represents the virtual environment necessary to run the application. Though this can be pulled from github and run locally, I don't have the time to scrutinize and troubleshoot how well this does across devices, and some unforeseen errors can occur. 

If you're here, I recommend just reading the ml_script.py. I made sure to document each code chunk.
